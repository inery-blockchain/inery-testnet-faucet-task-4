# Steps to create with a Svelte app

1. Create a new project
Create a new project using the NPM command 'npx degit sveltejs/your-folder-name template' (replace "your-folder-name" with the desired name for your project folder). Then, navigate to your project folder with the command 'cd your-folder-name'.

```
2. Installing dependencies

```
'yarn install' / 'npm install'
(to install all required dependencies for your project)
```
3. Run your project

```
run 'npm run dev' command to run your project.
This will open your app in your default browser on http://localhost:5000.

```
4. Edit your code
Once your project is up and running, you can start editing your code. The source code of the Svelte web application resides in the 'src' folder. The application's main files are 'main.js' and 'App.svelte'.

```
6. Generate your application
run 'npm run build' command to generate your app.
Your app will be stored in the 'public/build' folder.
