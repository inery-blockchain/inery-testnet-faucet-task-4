### Fixing Error

Thanks to: [alteregogi](https://github.com/alteregogi)

#### Error : Serialization time limit 15000us exceeded:

Change max-transaction-time to more than 15000 in your config.ini
```
nano ./inery-node/inery.setup/master.node/blockchain/config/config.ini
```

#### Error : connect ECONNREFUSED NODE_IP_ADDRESS:8888

Make sure to open your port setting on your VPS provider dashboard and make sure your VPS port **8888** is open, try to check it on [portchecker.co](https://portchecker.co/).

```
sudo ufw allow 8888
```

#### Error: missing create.issuer ( type=name )

You doesn't have Valued Smart Contract on your account, this is on Task 3.
