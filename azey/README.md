=================================================================================================================================================================
Welcome to the Azey repository! In order to run the script in this repository, there are a few prerequisites that you will need to have installed on your system.

First, you will need to have NodeJS installed. NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on your computer, rather than in a web browser.

In addition to NodeJS, you will also need to have NPM (Node Package Manager) installed. NPM is a package manager for NodeJS that allows you to easily install and manage third-party packages (libraries, tools, etc.) that your project depends on.

Once you have these prerequisites installed, you can begin running the script in this repository. To do so, first change your current directory to the Nama_Akun_Inery directory by running the following command in your terminal:

cd ~/inery-testnet-faucet-tasks/azey

Next, install the dependencies for this project by running the following command:

npm install

This will install all of the necessary packages that the script depends on.

Finally, you can run the script by using the following command:

npm run solution


This will execute the script and you should see the output in your terminal.
