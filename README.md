# Inery Testnet Faucet - Task 5

The goal of this task is to create a DApp that uses Inery Blockchain as a Data layer for the application. The DApp needs to have at least a simple front-end that will enable the user of your application to interact with the blockchain DB. Additionally, you will need to create a README.md file in which you will provide detailed instructions on how to run and test the application, specify account and contract name on what your DApp is based on.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository: `https://github.com/inery-blockchain/inery-testnet-faucet-tasks`
2. Create a new directory with your account name on the blockchain and add your code solution
3. Create a `README.md` file in the solution directory, and provide detailed instructions on how to run and test the application.
4. Publish your app online and provide us with a link of your project(you may use free web hosting or host on your own server)
5. Create a merge/pull request to the `task5` branch

## Evaluation 

If your solution is valid and tested, you will be approved for completion of task 5 of the Inery testnet faucet.
