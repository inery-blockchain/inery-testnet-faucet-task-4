Inery Testnet Task 4

This repository contains a solution for Task 4 of the Inery testnet, which requires the development of a software solution for the remote procedure call of the push_transaction blockchain's API.

Getting Started

Copy code

$ git clone https://github.com/inery-blockchain/inery-testnet-faucet-tasks.git

Navigate to the task4 branch:

Create a new directory named after your account name on the Inery blockchain and copy the code solution from the previous step into a new file named index.js in that directory.
