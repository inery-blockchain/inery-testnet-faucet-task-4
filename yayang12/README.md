# Inery DApp Example

This is a simple decentralized application (DApp) that uses the Inery Blockchain as its data layer. The purpose of this DApp is to demonstrate how to store data on the Inery Blockchain and retrieve it later.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer
- [Inery Blockchain Testnet](https://github.com/inery-blockchain/docs/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Inery-Blockchain) account
- [Inery API key](https://github.com/inery-blockchain/docs/wiki/API-Reference)

## Setup
1. Clone this repository

`git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/inery-testnet-faucet-tasks.git `

`cd inery-testnet-faucet-tasks/task5/[YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME] `

2. Install dependencies
`npm install`

3. Replace the placeholder in `app.js` with your Inery API key.

## Run

1. Start the DApp
`npm start`

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the DApp.

3. Input some data in the text field and click the submit button to store the data on the Inery Blockchain.

4. Verify the data is stored on the Inery Blockchain by going to the [Inery explorer](https://explorer.inery.io).

## Conclusion

This simple DApp demonstrates how to use the Inery Blockchain as a data layer for a decentralized application. The example is just a starting point, and you can build on it to create more complex and feature-rich applications.
