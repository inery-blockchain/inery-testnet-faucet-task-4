# This is a decentralized application built using the Inery Blockchain as its data layer.

# Requirements
1. Node.js
2. NPM
3. Inery Blockchain
4. A code editor of your choice (VSCode is recommended)
## Installation
## Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/Mysterious098/inery-testnet-faucet-tasks.git
```
## Go to the project directory and install the dependencies
```
npm install
```
## Running the DApp
```
npm run dev

```

This will start a development server that you can access at http://localhost:3000. You can now interact with the blockchain DB through the front-end of the DApp.

## Testing the DApp
To ensure that the DApp is working correctly, you can run the following command to check for any issues:

```
npm run check
```
This command will run the  utility and return any issues or errors that need to be addressed.svelte-check
## Building for Production
To build the DApp for production, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```
This will compile the source code and generate a production-ready build in the  directory.dist
## Previewing the Build
You can preview the production-ready build by running the following command:
```
npm run preview
```
This will start a local server that you can access at http://localhost:3000.
## Linting and Formatting
The project uses ESLint and Prettier for linting and formatting. To check for any linting issues, run the following command:
```
npm run lint
```
To automatically format the code, run the following command:
```
npm run format
```

## In conclusion, the project aims to create a decentralized application that leverages the Inery blockchain as its data layer, providing a simple front-end for users to interact with the blockchain database. The provided codes and instructions in this README.md file will assist you in setting up, running and testing the application.
